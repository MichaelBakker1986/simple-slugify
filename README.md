# "Simple Slugify"

is a JavaScript library that allows you to convert any string into a URL-friendly format, by replacing spaces with a chosen separator character. For example, you can turn "some string" into "some-string". The library is written in ES2015 JavaScript and has no dependencies.

The library can also convert foreign symbols into their English equivalents, based on a predefined mapping of characters. Additionally, it can work in the browser as well as with AMD/CommonJS module loaders.
